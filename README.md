# Implement syntax highlighting for [Perl XS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_(Perl)) files in VS Code

:camel: Open source contribution project :camel:

In Perl, XS is an abbreviation of "eXternal Subroutine". These subroutines are commonly written in hybrid language of XS directives and C/C++ code.
A file in XS format starts with a C language section which goes until the first `MODULE = ` directive. Other XS directives and XSUB definitions may follow this line. The "language" used in this part of the file is usually referred to as the [XS language](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs).

Currently there is no syntax highlighting extension for these files in VS Code.

# Implement syntax highlighting for [Perl XS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_(Perl)) files in VS Code

:camel: Open source contribution project :camel:

XS is a Perl foreign function interface through which a program can call a C or C++ subroutine. XS or xsub is an abbreviation of "eXternal Subroutine", where external refers to programming languages external to Perl.

Modules using xsubs commonly containes files written in the [XS language](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs).
Such a file is called an .xs file. These files are commonly mostly C or C++ code and some specific XS declarations for each xsub. Currently there is no syntax highlighting extension for these files in VS Code.

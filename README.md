# Implement syntax highlighting for [Perl XS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XS_(Perl)) files in VS Code

:camel: Open source contribution project :camel:

XS is an abbreviation of "eXternal Subroutine". An .xs file is written in hybrid language of [XS directives](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs) and C/C++ code. The file starts with a C/C++ language section which goes until the first `MODULE = ` directive. Then other XS directives and XSUB definitions may follow this line. The "language" used in this part of the file is usually referred to as the [XS language](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlxs).

Currently there is no syntax highlighting extension for these files in VS Code.
